DESCRIPTION:
    1.1 Time complexity:
        0(n) = O(n) = Linear. Traversing the array with two pointers, makes time complexity to n.
     
        

    1.2 Space complexity:
        0(n) = O(1) = Constant * (memory size python's variable)
        Traversal is executed in-pace and the needed space is always as the input (no more memory is needed)
