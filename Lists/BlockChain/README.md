DESCRIPTION:
    1. Time Complexity: as simple linked list, inserting time complexity O(n) = n = linear.
    2. Space complexity:
       Block chain is implemented using linked list,  so it allocates moemory dynamically.
       O(n) =  n ( size of nodes) * 
               h (number of atributes in the node) *
               m (size in bytes of the variable determined by python)
            = linear complextiy
