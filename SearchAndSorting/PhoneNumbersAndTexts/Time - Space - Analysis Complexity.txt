1. Task0
    O(n). Linear complexity. The worst case may occurs when the desired element is located at n-1 position.
2. Task1
    O(n ** 2). Cuadratic complexity. There are two edge cases: When all telephone number are repeated and when all 
               telephone numbers are unique i in both files.
3. Task2
    O(n). Linear complexity. The worst case may happen if the file is ordered ascendantly and the longest duration call is located at n-1 position.
4. Task3.
    O(n). Linear complexity. The worst case may occur if there are no phone numbers from and to Bangalore.
5. Task4.
    O(n ** 2). Cuadratic complexity. The worst case will happen if all calls made telemarketing because the algorithm
              shound check each register in texts and calls data.
