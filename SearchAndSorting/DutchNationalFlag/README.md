DESCRIPTION:
    1.1 Time complexity:
        0(n) = n = Linear. 
        This algo uses pointers to iterate over the list a visit each index in a single traversal.
        
    1.2 Space complexity:
        0(n) = (1). No space more than size in bytes of the input is needed,
                    because sorting is executed in the same array without allocating extras spaces.
