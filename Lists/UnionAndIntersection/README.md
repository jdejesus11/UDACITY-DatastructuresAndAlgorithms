DESCRIPTION:
1. TIME COMPLEXTIY: O(n) = n ** 2 = cuadratic complexity because
   in average, the algorithm should visit each element of the 
   first list per each element of the second element.

2. Space complexity analysis:
         1.2.1 It needs allocated n * m variables plius So 
         O(n) = ( n * m (size in bytes of each item determined by python)   ) ** 2 = cuadratic complexity.
